GETTING STARTED:

Script Editor:

The script editor window consists of two panes. The "Devices and Tests" pane and 
"Test Script" pane.  To select a pane and make it active, press the "TAB" key 
until the title of the desired pane is bolded. The items displayed in a pane may 
be scrolled up or down by using the arrow keys on the keyboard.

  Devices and Tests: This pane displays the system devices that were found
    on the current system in bold.  Indented and underneath each device is a
    list of the possible diagnostic tests that can be run on each device.
    From here the user can add tests to the current test script shown in the
    right pane called the "Test Script" pane. To add a test move up
    or down to the preferred test and press the "Enter" key.

  Test Script: This pane displays tests in the currently open test script. To
    get to this pane press the "Tab" key until the title of this pane is
    highlighted.  If you want to delete tests from this script, press the up
    and down arrow keys to move to the test you want to delete and then when
    the test is highlighted press the "delete" key.

  Note: To run the tests that are currently shown in the test script, press the
    "r" key.

Script List:

The script list window consists of two panes.  The "Script List" pane and the 
"Test Script" pane.  To select a pane and make it active, press the "TAB" key 
until the title of the desired pane is bolded. The items displayed in a pane may 
be scrolled up or down by using the arrow keys on the keyboard.

  Script List: This pane displays specific pre-created scripts that were found
    on the current system in bold.  The Devices and tests that will be run when
    this script is run are shown in the "Test Script" pane on the right.  You can 
    scroll up and down through these scripts to view each in turn. 
    
  Test Script: This pane displays tests in the current test script. To
    get to this pane press the "Tab" key until the title of this pane is
    highlighted.  If the script goes off the screen you can scroll through it with
    the up and down arrows.

  Note: To run the currently selected script press the "r" key.

EXAMPLE:

An example PC-Doctor session using the text user interface
might go as follows. First, the user starts PC-Doctor with the command:

pcd ui

Note: If in a Unix environment if the bin directory is not in the path you
      will need to prepend pcd with ./
      e.g.  ./pcd ui

This will enumerate all system devices and start the user interface. The user
will be presented with two panes: "Devices and Tests" and  "Test Script".
In this example we will run all the diagnostic tests on one CPU, find where
one of your CPU's is listed in the "Devices and Tests" pane. There will be
multiple subtests listed beneath it:

General Registers Test
Floating-Point Registers Test
Parallel Integer (MMX) Test
Parallel Floating-Point (SIMD) Test
Cache Test

To add these tests to the "Test Script" pane, scroll down to the "General
Registers Test" selection and press the "Enter" key. The "General Registers
Test" should now be in the "Test Script" pane. To add the rest of the tests,
repeat this procedure by scrolling down to each one and pressing the
"Enter" key. Once all the tests listed are in the "Test Script" pane,  run
these tests by pressing the "r" key.

As the script is running, the percentage complete for each test will be listed
once the test has finished running, and the "Result" column will
display whether the test passed or failed.
